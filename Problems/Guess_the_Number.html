<!-- Write a javascript program to generate a random number and store it in a 
variable. The program then takes an input from the user to tell them 
whether the guess was correct, greater or lesser than original number.
100 - (Number of guesses) is the score of user. The program is expected
to terminate once the number is guessed. Number should be between 1-100 -->
